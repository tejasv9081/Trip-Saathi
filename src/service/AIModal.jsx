These are estimated ranges for budget travel.\n*   **Transportation:** Public transportation is available, but ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft) may be convenient. You can also use the bus, but it is not as time efficient. Walking is also possible for many places.\n*   **Food:** To stay on budget, consider eating at affordable diners or take-out places. Look for daily specials and happy hour deals.\n*   **Reservations:** For some places you can purchase tickets online to get discounts.\n*   **Flexibility:** Be flexible and open to adjusting the itinerary depending on your interests and energy levels.\n\nI hope this helps you plan an amazing and affordable trip to Las Vegas!\n"},
